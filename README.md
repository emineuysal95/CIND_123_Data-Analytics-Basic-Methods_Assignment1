# CIND_123_Data-Analytics-Basic-Methods_Assignment1

The assignment explores fundamental data manipulation and analysis using R, including vector operations, indexing, handling missing values, factorial and product calculations, and data type identification. All tasks are completed in R and presented with both.

> ðŸ”” Note: According to assignment rules, all package installation lines (`install.packages`) have been commented out to ensure the RMD file can be knitted without errors.

## ðŸ“Œ Key Concepts Covered

### Question 1: Vector and Data Operations
- Generating sequences (`seq()`)
- Subsetting vectors by index
- Cubing selected elements
- Calculating `mean()` and `median()` on sub-vectors
- Handling factor variables correctly (`as.numeric(as.character())`)
- Reading CSV files with missing values and imputing them using `mean()`

### Question 2: Mathematical Logic and Functions
- Calculating summations using loops and factorials
- Computing a product series
- Understanding the behavior of `rep()`, `is.logical()`, `is.character()`, etc.
- Python equivalents explained (e.g., `map(float, list)`, `isinstance()`, `pd.isna()`)

## âœ… How to Run

1. Open `assignment1.Rmd` in **RStudio**.
2. Ensure the working directory contains `dataset.csv`.
3. Use the "Knit" button to generate the HTML or PDF report.

## ðŸ§  Author's Note

This assignment strengthened my understanding of R syntax and logic for data analysis. It provided hands-on experience with vector manipulation, missing value imputation, and evaluating mathematical expressions using programmatic approaches.
